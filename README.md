### Project goal:

The project investigates how multiple visual cortex maps prepare for the representation of an upcoming stimulus upon endogenous (voluntary) attentional cues. We collected fMRI data from 8 observers (the 9th observer was excluded from further analysis) across 4 scan sessions (around ~1 hour of data in each scan collected across 10 runs). Observers completed a trial-based orientation discrimination task with an attentional cue. On every trial, observers received an attentional cue and as they waited for the appearance of upcoming stimuli (target and distractors) a mapping stimulus appeared at a random, unpredictable location. We measured the BOLD response to the mapping stimuli for different attention conditions (see the paper for more details on the protocol).
