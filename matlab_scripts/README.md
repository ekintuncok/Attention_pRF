This repository simulates data for two models of spatial attention induced shifts to receptive fields. 

The first model, here named as the spotlight model, is based on the published work of Womelsdorf, Anton-Erxleben & Treue (2008). The model assumes that
the receptive field shifts induced by the allocation of attention to a location are a result of multiplicative gain changes in the early areas in visual processing.
It constructs a Gaussian-shaped attention field around the attended location with a certain size. The receptive field under the attentional load is defined as the
product of a Gaussian-shaped stimulus driven receptive field and the attention field. The neural and population responses are then the product of the input stimulus,
an attended location, and the a
